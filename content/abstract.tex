With the proliferation of distributed systems, robust testing methodologies have become paramount to ensure seamless integration and reliability. This article examines the adoption of a \ac{BDD} testing approach by influential entities, such as the \ac{DLR} in a distributed application, the \ac{RCE}. A comprehensive analysis of \ac{RCE}'s testing setup is presented, offering valuable insights into potential challenges encountered in \ac{BDD} testing, particularly for distributed systems. Furthermore, this article delves into an unexplored facet of network testing within \ac{RCE}, specifically addressing the introduction of artificial network failures to simulate real-world complexities. The primary objective of this exploration is to improve our understanding of the efficacy of \ac{BDD} testing in the context of \ac{RCE} and contribute to the refinement of its testing framework.
