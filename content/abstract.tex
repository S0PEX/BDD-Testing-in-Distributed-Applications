With the proliferation of distributed systems, robust testing methodologies have become paramount to ensure seamless integration and reliability. This paper examines the adoption of a \ac{BDD} Testing Approach by influential entities like the \ac{DLR} in their distributed application, the \ac{RCE}. A comprehensive analysis of RCE's BDD testing setup is presented, offering valuable insights into potential challenges encountered in testing distributed systems. Furthermore, the focus extends to an unexplored facet of network testing within RCE, specifically addressing the introduction of artificial network failures to simulate real-world complexities. This exploration aims to improve our understanding of the efficacy of BDD testing in the context of RCE and contribute to the broader discourse on testing methodologies for distributed systems.
