Short discussion of when to use Cucumber exp and when regex. Also outline pro's and cons of windivert vs k8s w/ chaos mesh

Cucumber Exp
Cucumber Expressions are designed to be more intuitive and straightforward, making them an excellent choice for common scenarios where patterns are relatively simple and direct. However, their simplicity comes at the cost of the extensive pattern-matching capabilities inherent to \ac{Regex}, that allow intricate and nuanced string manipulation, capable of handling a wide range of complex scenarios and edge cases with precision. This advanced functionality is particularly valuable in cases requiring detailed and specific pattern recognition, which might be beyond the scope of Cucumber Expressions. Therefore, while Cucumber Expressions significantly enhance readability and maintainability, developers and teams must carefully consider the requirements of their specific context when deciding between the two, weighing the benefits of simplicity against the need for comprehensive pattern-matching capabilities.
