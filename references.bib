@article{BODEN2021100759,
abstract = {Engineering complex systems such as air- and spacecraft is a multidisciplinary effort that requires the collaboration of engineers from a multitude of specializations working in concert. Typically, each engineer uses one or more specialized software tools to analyze some data set and passes, in an ad-hoc manner, the results on to their colleagues who require these results as input for their respective tools. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and not replicable. To alleviate this problem, we present RCE (Remote Component Environment), an open-source application developed primarily at DLR, that enables its users to intuitively integrate disciplinary tools, to define dependencies between them via an easy-to-use graphical interface, and to execute the resulting multidisciplinary engineering workflow. All data produced are stored centrally for provenance, subsequent analysis, and post-processing. Hence, RCE makes it easy for collaborating engineers to contribute their individual disciplinary tools to a multidisciplinary design or analysis, and simplifies the analysis of the workflow's results.},

The more people and research projects rely on the software in question, the more important it is that software updates implement new features correctly and do not introduce regressions. Thus, developers of research software must balance their limited resources between implementing new features and thoroughly testing any code changes.",
